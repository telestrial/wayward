# Wayward

Wayward is an in-development MUD ([Multi-User Dungeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD)) based off the [Evennia](https://www.evennia.com/) framework. In terms of theme, much is up in the air. Frankly, as a long-time player of MUDs (over two decades), this is a fun exercise to brush up on Python in an area of high familiarity. It is not a legitimate effort in game design/production/etcetera. I just think it's neat! Right now, the priority of development is in building out the base game-creation systems: builder tools around rooms, objects, and NPCs, extending Evennia's already existing toolset. In order to run it, you need to have evennia in a parent directory alongside this directory.
