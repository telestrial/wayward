# Wayward

Wayward is an in-development MUD ([Multi-User Dungeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD)) based off the [Evennia](https://www.evennia.com/) framework. In terms of theme, much is up in the air. Right now, the priority of development is in building out the base game-creation systems: builder tools around room, object, and NPC creation, extending Evennia's already existing toolset. In order to run it, you need to install evennia and have it in a parent directory with this directory. As a practical matter, it is an exercise in brushing up on Python and not a legitimate venture into game design/production/etc.

Evennia's documentation is here:
